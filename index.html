    <h1>Greennit</h1>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>My project is a website I designed named Greennit. This website is supposed to be somewhat of a reddit clone, hence the name, and be an area for people to discuss a variety of topics. 
      I found a bootstrap template for the design of the website and created my own pages based off that template.
      I originally made many more pages but I felt as if the project would be more streamlined if I put all the post on one page with a key for the category.
      I designed this so users and posts are saved in the server and posted to the users interface and also allowed users to log in using a similar process.
